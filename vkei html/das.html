    <h1>So what is basicaly VKEI?</h1>
    <p>Because visual kei style is based on what a large number of bands have worn over the years, the style can be very broad with no true rules or even brands. The most popular visual kei look is an androgynous look, similar to some looks worn by David Bowie (often referred to as Kote Kote Kei), but other looks have been popular over the years</p>
    <h2>About clothing</h2>
    <p><img src="https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000069186937-v4ssh9-t1080x1080.jpg" alt="kikyo" style="float: right;" width="200" length="300"> Because there are many different versions of visual kei, there are many different types of clothing that can be worn in the style.

        In more gothic versions of the style, things like dark lace, cobweb fabrics, skulls, crowns, crosses, and other spooky looks and fabrics will be used. More elegant, French rococco inspired looks, may include elaborate ball gowns. Punk looks may include plaid skirts or plaid patches on tops, striped tops, or ripped jeans with belts and buckles. There is even a toned-down version of visual kei that focuses on graphic t-shirts and jeans, with perhaps a sweater or vest or frock coat.
        
        The thing that unites all styles of visual kei is the final polished but distressed look. Although visual kei may feature many "misplaced" or "ripped" items, the final look still feels purposeful and clean, not messy. Intense makeup looks are popular in visual kei, but makeup is not meant to be overwhelming. Generally, light makeup is used across the face, such as foundation, with dark makeup focused around the eyes. Men and women both wear makeup in visual kei, and a look is rarely complete without it. Some substyles take makeup to more extremes and wear white shironuri-like makeup, but this is not required or consistent across styles.
