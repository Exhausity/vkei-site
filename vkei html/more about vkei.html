    <h2>Kotekei</h2>
    <p>In terms of fashion, Kote-kei artists are known for elaborate, sometimes gothic or Victorian-inspired outfits, dramatic makeup (often with bold eyeliner and pale foundation), and edgy hairstyles. Bands like Malice Mizer, Dir en Grey (early years), and X Japan in their visual peak were influential in shaping Kote-kei aesthetics.</p>
    <h2>Gothickei</h2>
    <p>Musicians in this style often incorporate dark themes into their music and visuals, using dramatic makeup, intricate costumes, and melancholic or mysterious imagery. The style is heavily influenced by goth aesthetics and emphasizes individualism and emotional depth.</p>
    <h2>Lolitakei</h2>
    <p>Lolita V-Kei bands and artists typically wear intricately detailed clothing in styles like Gothic Lolita (dark colors, crosses, lace) or Sweet Lolita (pastel colors, bows, ruffles). Musically, Lolita V-Kei can range from softer, romantic sounds to more intense rock and gothic tones, but always emphasizes theatricality and elegance. Bands like Kaya and artists with ties to Mana (from Malice Mizer and Moi dix Mois) have popularized this aesthetic.</p>
    <h2>Angurakei</h2>
    <p>is a subgenre of Visual Kei focused on traditional Japanese themes, dark aesthetics, and countercultural expression. Rooted in Japan’s angura (underground) theater movement, Angura Kei fuses Visual Kei’s flamboyant style with elements like kimonos, samurai or traditional motifs, and kabuki-inspired makeup. It often reflects a deep connection to Japanese history, folklore, or social critique.</p>
